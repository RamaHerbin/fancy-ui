# Changelog

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 8eb3ae6: feat: add FrostedGlass component — turbulence-noise glass refraction (alternative to LiquidGlass)
- b420f1c: Add multi-language support to the docs site: a language switcher in the header with 16 locales (en, fr, es, de, it, pt, pl, cs, ja, ko, zh-Hans, hi, id, tr, ar, fa), including full RTL layout for Arabic and Persian. UI chrome and the getting-started guides are translated (machine-translated drafts pending native review); the component registry stays English as the machine-facing source. Docs-site only — no change to the published component API.
- 7ed0256: Add a multi-theme switcher to the docs header — a swatch dropdown to pick from named themes (Light, Dark, Cupcake, Emerald, Corporate, Retro, Cyberpunk, Synthwave, Dracula, Forest, Sunset, Ocean, Mono) plus System. Each theme applies site-wide via CSS-variable overrides, persists in localStorage, and toggles light/dark. Docs-site only — no change to the published component API.

### Patch Changes

- 8362a2b: Fix the Component Copilot system prompt: it taught the wrong install command (`pnpm add fancy-ui` / `import … from 'fancy-ui'`) instead of the real package `fancy-ui-svelte`, and a hardcoded "60+ components" that had drifted from the registry. The count is now derived from the registry so it never drifts again, and the prompt now documents the required `@import "fancy-ui-svelte/tailwind.css";` stylesheet line without which Tailwind generates none of the component classes. Docs-site only — no change to the published component API.
- d6a3f89: fix(pkg): ship `dist/utils` in the published package

  The `files` array listed the file `dist/utils.js` but not the `dist/utils/` directory, so `dist/utils/animation.js` (and `color.js`/`geometry.js`) were never published. Any consumer importing from the barrel pulled in `NoiseReveal`, whose `import ... from "../../utils/animation.js"` then failed to resolve at bundle time, breaking the consumer's build. Adding `dist/utils` to `files` restores the missing directory.

- 57f0650: chore: add Storybook 10 with SvelteKit integration for component development and documentation
- 724f108: Add an interactive Theme Generator page to the docs — tune OKLCh color, radius, motion, and rainbow-palette tokens with live sliders, preview components re-theme in real time, and copy the generated CSS.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ede21f: Add NoiseReveal component: WebGL image reveal with a Perlin-noise dissolve mask, contracting radial gradient, and wave displacement, inspired by a Codrops shader effect
- 8be8831: Add LineReveal and EditorialEngine components powered by @chenglou/pretext:
  LineReveal staggers a line-by-line text reveal with lines computed by canvas
  text measurement instead of DOM splitting; EditorialEngine renders a live
  magazine layout (multi-column flow with cursor handoff, auto-fitted headline,
  drop cap, pullquotes) where text reflows in real time around draggable orbs
  with zero DOM reads.

### Patch Changes

- d17b72b: docs: clarify release pipeline and fix branch name in CONTRIBUTING.md
- 9410c20: Fix bundle correctness and tighten the dependency surface:
  - Export `Dock` (and `DockIcon`, `DockSeparator`) from the package entrypoint — the component was registered and shipped under `dist/`, but never re-exported, making it unreachable from `import { Dock } from "fancy-ui-svelte"`.
  - Remove the dead `fluid-cursor-advanced` registry entry left over from the merge into `FluidCursor` — the component folder no longer exists, so the registry was advertising a non-shippable slug.
  - Move `@vercel/analytics` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` — it's only used by the docs site (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`) and was unnecessarily pulled into consumer installs.
  - Drop the no-op `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` flag from `tsconfig.json` — it has no effect with `moduleResolution: bundler` + SvelteKit's build pipeline.
  - Fix README component count: `52`/`57` → `56`.
  - Add `pnpm check:registry` (and run it in CI) — parses `src/lib/fancy-ui/registry.ts`, `src/lib/fancy-ui/index.ts`, and the component folders, and fails if they drift. Catches both quoted (`"book": { ... }`) and bare-identifier (`book: { ... }`) registry keys.

- 8bdd475: Add llms.txt and llms-full.txt endpoints serving LLM-friendly documentation generated from the component registry
